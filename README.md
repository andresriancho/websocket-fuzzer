## Websocket Fuzzer

A simple websocket fuzzer for application penetration testing.

Two tools are provided:

 * `websocket-fuzzer.py`: Receives a websocket message, modifies it, and 
 then sends it in different connections. The response is analyzed to find
 potential vulnerabilities.
 
 * `send-one-message.py`: Sends a websocket message using a new connection

Both tools require considerable customization to be used. Please read the
source code comments in both files to better understand all the parameters.

## Installation and usage

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

# edit send-one-message.py
python send-one-message.py
```

In most cases you'll want to use a proxy, such as OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite, to
analyze the websocket traffic generated by these tools. Both tools support
proxying the websocket traffic.

## Authentication

The tools support authenticating using user-defined websocket messages. These
messages are sent before the ones with the payloads.

## Logging

All messages are logged to a user-defined directory. Each connection is logged
to a different file. Detailed logging is very important for this tool, since
it allows the user to run `grep` on the output to find interesting things.

## Fuzzing

The tool was developed for fuzzing websocket applications which use `JSON`
as a serialization method. If this is not the case for you, please customize
the following functions:

    * `create_tokenized_messages`
    * `replace_token_in_json`
